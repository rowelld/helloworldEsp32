 * 
 * GSM AT is generic and advanced library for communicating to SIM800/900 and SIM7000/7020
 * wG/LTE modems using AT commands
 *
 * It is intented to work with embedded systems and is device and platform independent.
 *
 * \section         sect_features Features
 *
 *  - Supports `SIM800/900 (2G)` or `SIM7000/SIM7020 (NB-IoT)` modules
 *  - Platform independent and very easy to port
 *     - Development of library under Win32 platform
 *     - Provided examples for ARM Cortex-M or Win32 platforms
 *  - Written in C language (C99)
 *  - Allows different configurations to optimize user requirements
 *  - Supports implementation with operating systems with advanced inter-thread communications
 *      - Currently only OS mode is supported
 *      - 2 different threads handling user data and received data
 *          - First (producer) thread (collects user commands from user threads and starts the command processing)
 *          - Second (process) thread reads the data from ESP device and does the job accordingly
 *  - Allows sequential API for connections in client and server mode
 *  - Includes several applications built on top of library:
 *      - \ref GSM_APP_MQTT_CLIENT for MQTT connection
 *  - User friendly MIT license
